### 3. Copyleft.

You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy of it. This License will continue to apply to the modified work.

### 4. Additional Terms.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the rights granted by this License. For example, you may not impose a requirement that additional software be distributed with the Work or any Derivative Works.

### 5. No Warranty.

The work is provided "as is," without any warranty of any kind. There is no warranty for merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

### 6. Limitation of Liability.

In no event shall the author or distributor be liable for any damages arising out of the use of the Work.
